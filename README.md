# lite-xl-vibe
VI(m?) Bindings (with a hint of Emacs) for lite-xl



heavily inspired by and originally started from [modalediting of a327ex's lite-plugins](https://github.com/a327ex/lite-plugins)


Yes, I am aware of the vim-mode branch, but
- Really - lite and lite-xl openly state that any additional functionality thet can be added via plugin should be added in that manner and I sort of believe that it can be in this case
- X fingers crossed but I'd franko'ly choose my own way instead of the one that the core features are implemented in. (although I am afraid that is only because I haven't made those features myself yet and when I do, my own version would probably be soo damn unusable..)
- I really want to build sth like that myself
